        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="http://ianharker.net/images/ianphoto.png" width="220" height="220" alt="" style="float:left;"/>  I've been a gamer since I was around the age of four years old. Because of my early involvement, I believe it is where I got my interest in making games. 
          
        I got my first debugging experience at that young age when I was a playtester for an Atari Jaguar game called Battlesphere. </p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Years later, I started to learn programming languages such as VB, C/C++, HTML, and C#. The first game design and programming I learned was when I played with Graal 2001's map editor and an engine called BYOND. (I even have one of the fabled "Blue Books"!) My latest endeavour is teaching myself PHP, MySQL, and jQuery.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I recently graduated from DePaul University with  Bachelor's of Science in Game Development,  a minor in Animation and another minor in Japanese! 日本語を勉強していますよ！I am following my dreams to live and work in the Japanese game/animation industries.</p><br /><br />
